# üß† Active Directory Lab ‚Äì Lab Report

## üìò Overview

This lab simulates a small business environment using Windows Server 2022 and Windows 10 Pro to implement Active Directory, Group Policy, and basic domain infrastructure. The goal was to build hands-on experience with AD Domain Services, Group Policy Objects (GPOs), organizational structure, and domain client management.

## üñ•Ô∏è Machines

### üìå `DC01` ‚Äì Domain Controller
- OS: Windows Server 2022
- Hostname: `DC01`
- Static IP: `192.168.100.10`
- Roles: AD DS, DNS

### üìå `Client01` ‚Äì Domain Client
- OS: Windows 10 Pro
- Hostname: `Client01`
- Static IP: `192.168.100.11`
- Role: Client joined to `corp.local`

---

## üèóÔ∏è Network Architecture

> See ![Network Diagram](../network-diagram.png)

- `DC01` provides DNS, DHCP (optional), and AD services
- `Client01` communicates with `DC01` to authenticate and receive policies

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Summary

### 1. Install and Configure `DC01`
- Installed Windows Server 2022
- Assigned static IP: `192.168.100.10`
- Renamed to `DC01`
- Installed AD DS and DNS
- Promoted to domain controller with domain name: `corp.local`

### 2. Configure Active Directory
- Created Organizational Units:
  - `OU=IT`
  - `OU=HR`
  - `OU=Sales`
- Created Users:
  - `hruser`, `salesuser`, `itadmin`
- Created Groups:
  - `HR Group`, `Sales Group`, `IT Admins`
- Added users to relevant groups

### 3. Setup `Client01` and Join to Domain
- Installed Windows 10 Pro
- Renamed to `Client01`
- Assigned static IP: `192.168.100.11`, DNS: `192.168.100.10`
- Joined domain: `corp.local`
- Rebooted and logged in as `corp\hruser`

---

## üîê Group Policy Configuration

### GPO 1: Password Policy
- Enforces minimum password length of 12
- Complexity requirements enabled
- Applied to entire domain (`corp.local`)

### GPO 2: Network Drive Mapping for Sales
- Created shared folder: `\\DC01\Sales`
- Mapped as `Z:` drive via GPO
- GPO linked to `Sales` OU
- Applied only to `salesuser`


---

## ‚úÖ Testing & Verification

### üîπ Password Policy
- Attempted to change password as user with weak password ‚Üí rejected
- Confirmed password rules via `gpresult /r`

### üîπ Drive Mapping
- Logged in as `salesuser`
- Confirmed `Z:` drive mapped to `\\DC01\Sales`
- Verified access to files

## üìö Lessons Learned

- **DNS is critical** for domain join and policy enforcement.
- GPOs allow **powerful, centralized configuration** of user environments.
- **Testing policies** on a per-OU basis is key before deploying widely.
- Errors like misapplied GPOs often stem from **incorrect OU placement** or **permissions**.

---

## üß† Future Improvements

- Automate user and group creation via PowerShell
- Add WSUS server for patch testing
- Add second DC for replication
- Add Linux client and attempt Samba domain join
- Explore Restricted Groups and Group Policy Loopback Processing
